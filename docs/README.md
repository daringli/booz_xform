# Notes on documentation

* The documentation appearing on github.io/booz_xform is built using the GitHub Actions script `../.github/workflows/docs.yml`
* You can also build the documentation locally, by running the following from this directory (`docs/`):

~~~~
doxygen
make html
~~~~

* After these commands are run, you can open `docs/build/html/index.html` to view the documentation. This local build requires doxygen and several python packages: sphinx, sphinx_rtd_theme, and breathe. These python packages can be installed using `pip install`.
* The breathe package is used to convert doxygen xml output so it can be used by sphinx.
* The files `Makefile` and `make.bat` in this directory were generated by `sphinx-quickstart`.
